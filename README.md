   - Now, we must download MySQL Workbench to create our database
	- Once we have established the localhost connection, we must create a database (Schema) called funflexdb
	- the localhost user must be "root" (default user) and must not have a password

- Use the `cd` command to navigate to your desktop and press enter.
```bash
  $ cd Desktop/
```
- Copy and paste the following command to clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/AndresVilladaPoli/FUNFLEX.git`

- Navigate to the frontend directory within the cloned directory.
```bash
  $ cd frontend/
```
- Run the `npm install` command to install Node.js dependencies
```bash
  $ npm install
```
- Then, run the command `npm start` to start the frontend
```bash
  $ npm start

## Development Approach

We followed the traditional methodology for coding. For the frontend development, we utilized React.js framework, while for the backend, Spring Boot was employed. Additionally, Visual Studio Code was the IDE used for development.
